# Gem

File uploading for Zend Framework 

## Introduction 

Gem allows for easy file uploading and control over uploaded files. Gem works as 
an plugin to Zend_Db_Table.

### Example

#### The Photo Model

    class Photos extends App_Db_Table
    {
        protected $_attachment = array(
            'column'      => 'file', 
            'store_path'  => /my/store/path/,
            'manipulator' => 'ImageTransform',
            'styles' => array(
                'small' => array( 
                     'width' => 200), 
                'medium' => array( 
                     'width' => 400),
                'large' => array( 
                     'width' => 650),
            ),
        );
    
        protected function _setupPlugins()
        {
            $attachment = new Gem_Db_Table_Plugin_Attachment($this->_attachment);
            $this->addPlugin($attachment);
        }
    }

#### Controller and View

In the controller create a new photo

    $photos = new Photos();
    $photo = $this->createRow();  
    $photo->file = new ArrayObject($_FILES); // Or a real path to an existing file 
    $photo->save();

In the view all you need to display a large version of the uploaded image is

    echo $photo->file->large->url();

## Installation
