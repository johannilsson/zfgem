# Gem

File uploading for Zend Framework 

## Introduction 

Gem allows for easy file uploading and control over uploaded files. Gem works as 
an plugin to Zend_Db_Table.

### Example

In the controller

  $photos = new Photos();
  $this->view->photo = $photos->findOne(1);

And in the Photos model we need some configuration

  protected $_attachment = array(
    'column'      => 'file', 
    'store_path'  => 'path/to/store/your/uploads',
    'styles'      => array(
      'small'  => array('width'  => 200), 
      'medium' => array('width'  => 400),
      'large'  => array('width'  => 650)
    ),
  );

In the template to display a large version of the uploaded image.

  <img src="<?php echo $photo->file->large->url() $?>" alt="" />

## Installation

## Credits

ruby on rails.
